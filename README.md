# Start-up School - Culture Tech

### What is it Startup School ?
Start-up school is a program designed by 42E to help you launching your start-up project. We will create a little batch of very motivated people, we eill meet weekly and organise talks and support amongs us for 3 months! We will have talks about tech (pragmatism in code, git understanding, etc), business (POC, bootstraping, market-fit, etc) and more.

### Who is this for ?
People who want to write their own adventure. We are looking for motivated students who want to take their independence and start a startup. If you are still not sure about starting a startup you may want to read [**A student's guide to startup**](http://www.paulgraham.com/mit.html) or [**Why to not not start a startup**](http://www.paulgraham.com/notnot.html) from P. Graham.

### How long ?
The program is designed for a 3 month duration, but 42E will accompany you as long as you may need it!

### Content
The content will be designed with the first sessions of startup school. We will have regular mandatory & optionnal workshop on tech / legal / business / design.
We will have weekly standups to talk about the problems we face to face it together.
There will be mandatory talks presented by __you__ as a startup founder on subject of your choice for the startup school batch.
