# Business

---

## Do you really need to code

No. At first

---

## MVP or Tracer bullet

Use tracer bullets to find the target

- Users get to see something working early

^ if you communicate well enough, users will now it's not stable yet, but they will see that each iteration brings you closer to the final result

- Developers build a structure to work in

^ it's easier to work with the target in mind. now you just need to uprade and affinate each step of the process

- You always have something to demonstrate

---

## Iterate

- Get feedback
- Watch your KPIs (but don't be crazy)


---

## Pragmatic programmer

- DRY (Don't repeat yourself)

- KISS (Keep it simple, stupid!)

---

## Orthogonality

>  The basic idea of orthogonality is that things that are not related conceptually should not be related in the system. Parts of the architecture that really have nothing to do with the other, such as the database and the UI, should not need to be changed together. A change to one should not cause a change to the other.
